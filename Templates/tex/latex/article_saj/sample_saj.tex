\section{INTRODUCTION}

\indent

In 1933, Karl Jansky discovered radio wave emissions from the Sagittarius constellation in the Milky Way. This monumental discovery opened the door for modern radio astronomy. 

Radio astronomy is the study of the universe at radio frequencies. While the waves emitted at these frequencies are not visible to the naked eye, they are extremely important for the study of several astronomical phenomenon. Celestial objects which emit strong radio waves are called radio sources. Neutron stars, pulsars, radio galaxies and black holes are some of the most prominent radio sources. The background radiation left over after the Big Bang, called the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), is also an important radio source which helps us study the origins of the universe.


\section{RADIO WAVES}




Radio emissions give us a lot more visibility of the cosmos compared to standard optical emissions. Radio waves can easily penetrate dust and gas which generally absorbs and scatters radiation in most other wavebands. This allows us to study the structure of galaxies and molecular clouds in great detail. However, all radio emissions are not generated by the same process. We can broadly categorise them into two major types - thermal and non thermal processes.

\subsection{Thermal radiation}

\par\hang\textindent{(i)} submission to the journal (more detailed instructions are available upon
request),

\par\hang\textindent{(ii)} referee is chosen by the editors and we are
waiting for his report,

\par\hang\textindent{(iii)} referee's report has been received and (minor or major)
revision is required (note that this step may be repeated couple
of times), or acceptance/rejection of the paper has been
suggested. If revised paper has not been received within 3 months it will be
considered withdrawn.

\par\hang\textindent{(iv)} If paper has been accepted, before publication author
will receive a proof of his/her article for small corrections. The
proof is used solely for checking the typesetting and editing,
also the completeness and correctness of the text, tables, and
figures. Changes to the article as accepted for publication will
not be considered at this stage.

\par\hang\textindent{(v)} Paper has been published and it is available electronically at SerAJ website and
shortly after in hard copy, as well
as in the selected bibliographic services.

\section{INSTRUCTIONS}

\indent

In the following subsections we will give some examples how to
typeset mathematical formulas, include figures and tables and
correctly prepare references. Our intention is not to cover all possible aspects
of preparing a scientific text -- for more detailed instructions
one should consult some of the many \LaTeX\ manuals.

Here is just an example of quotation:

\vskip.2cm

\noindent {\nineit Astronomy is useful because it raises us above
ourselves; it is useful because it is grand$\dots$ It shows us how
small is man's body, how great his mind, since his intelligence
can embrace the whole of this dazzling immensity, where his body
is only an obscure point, and enjoy its silent harmony.}

\subsection{Equations, figures, tables}

\indent

\LaTeX\ is good at typesetting mathematical formulas or symbols
such as $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\Gamma$, $\Sigma$, $\pi$, $\nabla$, $\partial$, $\forall$, $\exists$, $\times$, $\pm$, $\infty$ etc.
Equations should be enumerated.

% Equations

The following is an example of equation:
\begin{equation}
\Sigma=AD^{-\beta}.
\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

% "\begin{equation}" can be replaced with "$$"
% "\end{equation}" can be replaced with "$$"
% In that case "\label{(number)}" may be replaced with "\eqno{(number)}"

One can also use equation arrays:
\begin{lefteqnarray}
\label{eq:f}
&& f(x)=\log(x^2+3x), \\
\label{eq:g}
&& g(x)=x+\sin x,
\end{lefteqnarray}
or
% SUBEQUATIONS
subequations (i.e. subequation arrays):
\begin{leftsubeqnarray}
\slabel{eq:casa}
&& \sin\theta=0.24, \\
\slabel{eq:casb} && \cos\alpha=0.47. \label{seq:cas}
\end{leftsubeqnarray}
In the text equations should be quoted Eq. (\ref{eq:1}) or Eqs. (\ref{eq:f}) and (\ref{eq:g}).

% \slabel{eq:namei} recalls the single equation e.g. (2i) (i=a,b,...)
%
% \label{seq:name}  recalls the whole group of subequations e.g., (2)

% Tables

Tables \ref{table1} and \ref{table2} are examples of tables. For large tables it is
necessary to switch from two column to single column environment.
Table \ref{table1} gives number of students graduated from Department of
Astronomy, Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade in a
given period. For more information check Belgrade astronomical
community database -- BAZA (from Serbian: Beogradska Astronomska
ZAjednica) at \url{http://alas.matf.bg.ac.rs/\~astrobaza/} (see
also \citeauthor{2009ata} \citeyear{2009ata}).

Table \ref{table2} shows the number of articles published in SerAJ, number of
cites to articles published in SerAJ (self cites and other cites)
and calculated impact factors (IF) for years
2003--2010.\footnote{More information about SerAJ citation can be
found in \citet{2007Arb,2010Arb,2013Arb}.}

Figs. \ref{fig1} and \ref{fig2} are examples of small and large figure,
respectively. Figures should be in ps or eps format with
recommended resolution 600 dpi (300 dpi minimum). Figure captions should be
below the figure itself. As with the tables, for large figures it
is necessary to switch from two column to single column
environment, and then switch back to two columns afterwards.

\subsection{Citations and references}

\indent

Make sure that all the citations that appear in the text are listed
correctly in the References, ordered alphabetically by surname
(with initials following). If there are several references to the
same first author, they should be entered according to the
following scheme:

\parindent=.7cm

\par\hang\textindent{(1)} one author: chronologically,

\par\hang\textindent{(2)}  author and one co-author: alphabetically by co-author, then
chronologically,

\par\hang\textindent{(3)} author, two or more co-authors: chronologically.

\parindent=.5cm

You can cite an author directly in the text, such as \citet{1986Ber},
or after some statement, in parentheses separated by
commas \citep{2020Doe,1978Bel,1983All,1987Bin,1998Cas,2004Uro,2005Cir,2007Met,2008Ive,2020Smith,
2015aste.book..297N}. Use
'et al.' in the text for more than two authors, and in the
references for more than eight authors (the first three being named). If more than one citation
for a particular author (author group) is made for the same year,
'a', 'b', 'c', $\ldots$ should be added to the year. Do not
include the title in a reference, except for books and monographs
that are not published in periodical publications. If citation does
not correspond to any publication, after the author's name and
year one usually puts: 'in preparation' or 'private communication'.
If paper has not been published yet and there is no ArXiv preprint
either, instead of the full reference with pagination one can put
journal's title followed by one of these statements: 'submitted',
'accepted', 'in press', or put DOI number if available. Use short (ADS)
journals abbreviations when preparing references (e.g.
SerAJ).\footnote{A list of journals in astronomy and
astrophysics, space sciences and related fields, together with its
abbreviations is available at
\url{http://saj.math.rs/index.php?id=abbr}.}
